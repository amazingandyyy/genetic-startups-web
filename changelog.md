# Changelog for Genetic Startups Web

This file keeps a log of version releases. It is maintained 
[following best practices about changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Versioning guideline

* Each significant change should be described in the "Unreleased" section
* Entry versions should follow the following:
  * Syntax:
    * [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD (Short description)
  * Convention:
    * For X.Y.Z, increment the digit following this scheme:
      * X = breaking change (previous version is now deprecated),
      * Y = additive change (previous version is still valid),
      * Z = just a simple patch (for a typo or error).
* When the new version is released, a new [Unreleased] section is created in the "Release Change History" below, as a 
placeholder for the next version.
